Did you ever find wrinkles on your face? It is because as we age, the production of collagen in our body decreases, leading to increased wrinkles, fine lines, and sagging skin.
 
What is collagen?
Collagen is the important protein that forms the building blocks of your skin, hair, nails, and connective tissues. It is found naturally in skin, providing strength and elasticity.
So retinol collagen cream helps in increasing collagen in your skin, leading to repair damaged skin and reducing the sagging. Let’s delve into the magic of retinol collagen cream and understand why it’s a must-have in your skincare arsenal.
 
The Power of Retinol
Retinol is one of the best-known skin care ingredients on the market. Retinol carries vitamin A that helps in treating aging of skin and acne. It does not remove dead skin cells as many products do; instead, it goes deep beneath the outer layer of skin to treat the skin.
This helps in producing collagen and elastin that can help in reducing the appearance of
	• Fine line
	• Wrinkles
	• Enlarged pores
 
Benefits of Retinol Collagen Cream
 
	• Reduces Wrinkles and Fine Lines: the combination of retinol in the cream helps in the production of collagen in skin, while added collagen in the cream increases skin elasticity and reduces wrinkles from the face
 
	• Improves Skin Texture: Regular use of retinol increases the rate of collagen, resulting in even-toned skin.
 
 
	• Enhances Hydration: collagen helps in locking moisture in skin, resulting in more hydrated and glowing skin.
 
	• Promotes Cell Turnover: Retinol accelerates the process of falling of old cells,  revealing fresh, new skin beneath.
 
	• Protects Against Environmental Damage: Retinol collagen cream creates a barrier that provides protection to the skin from harmful UV rays and pollution.
 
How to Use Retinol Collagen Cream
For better results, use retinol collagen cream at night as part of your skincare routine. Apply a small amount of the cream to your face, avoiding the delicate eye area. Gently massage it into your skin using upward and outward motions.
After this, apply moisturizer to lock in the benefits. Remember, retinol can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, so always apply sunscreen during the day.
